/* 1.0 Basic HTML *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

This is the first type of challenge you will see in this course. A small piece of HTML code will help you practice what you just learned. Sometimes we will have some styles with CSS.

Naturally, there are many things in the index.html that we haven't learned about yet. You can safely ignore all the code, as we'll explain it in the following chapters.

Replace the Hello World text with Sports benefits. Make sure that the <h1>...</h1> tags remain in the code and wrap the words Sports benefits. Then, click on the browser tab to visualize the end result.
