Intro to accessibility
Last updated April 2022

This course bakes accessibility into the learning journey of HTML and CSS. It's a core concept that we'll keep coming back to in this course. But what does 'accessibility' mean?

In the English language, the word accessibility means:

    the quality of being able to be reached or entered.

In the context of programming, accessibility refers to:

    Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system. The concept focuses on enabling access for people with disabilities or enabling access through assistive technology. Improved accessibility benefits everyone. (From Wikipedia)

We'll come back to assistive technology in a bit.

In the context of HTML (and websites in general), accessibility refers to making your website usable for everyone.
Why is it important?

We sometimes think about accessibility being either 1 or 0 (True or False). You either have it, or you don't. We also believe that if you do not have any disability, then this will not change forever. However, this is far from the truth.

Disability is a spectrum. It covers a wide range of sometimes 'weakened' abilities. For example (but not limited to):

    vision impairment.
    deaf or hard of hearing.
    mental health conditions.
    intellectual disability.
    acquired brain injury.
    autism spectrum disorder.
    physical disability.

It's important not to approach the concept of accessibility as a 1 or 0 (True or False). That's because people have a range of abilities.
People have a range of abilities

The paragraphs below were taken from gov.uk's excellent blog post: What we mean when we talk about accessibility

    All too often services are designed with the perfect user in mind. But, people's functional abilities vary hugely. Sight and hearing ranges from perfect to none, with a full spectrum in between. People's literacy levels and memory vary due to common conditions such as dyslexia, autism, dementia and stress. Physical ability vary with differences in mobility, dexterity, strength and levels of pain.

    As we get older our functional abilities deteriorate. Over half of the population over the age of 65 experience some kind of disability.

    We also all experience temporary disabilities caused by illness or injury. We experience situational disabilities such as not being able to hear well due to being in a noisy room or not being able to see well due to bright sunlight.

    We need to deliver services that accommodate the range of abilities that the people using them actually have.

As we get older, our functional abilities deteriorate

It's sometimes important to stress this one. When you write accessible code, your future self will thank you. We are writing websites that we will use years from now. Our range of abilities might very well change a few years from now.
Benefits of accessibility

Accessibility is not a chore. There are plenty of benefits that you will get when you write accessible code!

Here are some benefits of accessibility:

    It's a technical skill that you add to your tool belt.
    It helps you practice empathy.
    It increases the conversion rate for your product as you allow more people to use it.
    You get to decide whether you give people access or deny them access to your product. By making it accessible, you are allowing them to access it.
    In some countries or organizations, accessibility is a legal requirement. That is the case in several countries.

In this course, you will learn about accessibility step by step as we learn new concepts in HTML/CSS. This will make the concept of accessibility accessible ;).
