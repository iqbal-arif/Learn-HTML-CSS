Chapter recap

Congratulations on completing the 2nd chapter!
Further reading

Would you like to read more about the concept of semantics? Check out Semantics, what does it mean? by Erik Kroes. Note that the article refers to some elements we haven't learned about yet.
HTML element vs HTML tag

It might be confusing when we say HTML element vs. HTML tag.
An HTML tag is an HTML element wrapped with < and > (or </ and >). So, h1 is an HTML element whereas <h1> is an HTML tag. </h1> is also an HTML tag.

In this chapter, we learned about the concept of semantics, which we will continuously revisit throughout this course. In the next chapter, we'll learn about the concept (and importance) of accessibility!

This is your first chapter recap! You can save it to your notes by clicking on the + icon on the top-right of the recap.

Chapter Recap

    Writing semantic HTML means giving meaning to the elements we use.
    Semantic HTML focuses on providing meaning and purpose for the elements you use.
    Some of the benefits of semantic HTML:
        It makes your code machine-readable. Browsers and search engines will better understand your website.
        It helps you make sense of the information on the page.
        It helps you maintain the code as it makes it a lot more readable.
    The heading 1 h1 element is used to represent the highest-level, most important topic of the current web page.
    <h1>Most important topic of the page</h1>
    When writing HTML code, it's important to focus on the semantics rather than the appearance. HTML is meant for the content, and the structure, whereas
    CSS is used to style that content (appearance).
    You should not use an HTML element based on its appearance but rather its meaning/purpose/role.
    If you're not sure which element should be labeled as the h1 on the page, ask yourself: What is the most important topic on this page?
    Emmet is a code editor plugin that allows you to write HTML faster (among other things).
    Instead of writing <h1></h1> yourself, you can type h1 and then press the Tab key on your keyboard and the h1 will automatically be replaced by
    <h1></h1>.
